# Potential Enhancements for the Maestro LLM Agent Plugin

This document outlines potential future enhancements for the Maestro LLM Agent Plugin, which connects Mattermost to an LLM-powered agent for project and conversation management.

## I. User Experience & Interaction

1.  **Rich Message Formatting:**
    *   Allow the LLM agent to send messages with richer formatting (Markdown tables, lists, code blocks, embedded links, user mentions) for better readability and interaction in Mattermost.
2.  **Interactive Components (Buttons/Menus):**
    *   Enable the agent to include interactive elements like buttons or dropdown menus in its messages (e.g., for approving suggestions, assigning tasks directly from the chat).
3.  **Advanced Thread Management:**
    *   Provide tools for better conversation management within Mattermost threads, such as automated summarization by the agent or Q&A about thread history.
4.  **User-Specific Contextual Memory:**
    *   Allow users to set personal preferences or context (e.g., reporting style, working hours) that the agent remembers and utilizes in future interactions.
5.  **Proactive Notifications & Suggestions:**
    *   Enable the agent to proactively send messages or suggestions to users/channels based on its project management capabilities (e.g., upcoming deadlines, unblocked tasks) without requiring a direct command.
6.  **Natural Language Command Processing:**
    *   Evolve from `!maestro <command>` to more natural language understanding, allowing the plugin/agent to interpret intent from regular channel messages or direct messages to the bot.
7.  **Dedicated Slash Commands:**
    *   Introduce slash commands for common, discrete actions (e.g., `/maestro_create_task`, `/maestro_my_tasks`) for quicker access and better discoverability.

## II. Advanced Functionality & Integration

8.  **Structured Data Exchange:**
    *   Define and use clear JSON schemas for requests and responses between the plugin and the LLM agent, enabling more complex interactions and integrations (e.g., updating channel headers, creating polls, interacting with external systems).
9.  **File Uploads and Processing:**
    *   Allow users to upload files (documents, images, spreadsheets) that the plugin can forward to the LLM agent for analysis, summarization, or data extraction.
10. **Calendar & Task Management Integration:**
    *   Deepen integration with user calendars and Mattermost-based (or external) task management tools for scheduling, task creation from conversations, and reminders.
11. **Multi-Channel Project Context:**
    *   Enable the agent to maintain a coherent understanding of a project's status and context by being aware of and participating in multiple relevant Mattermost channels.
12. **On-Demand Summarization:**
    *   Implement commands like `!maestro summarize #channel [timeframe]` or `!maestro summarize this thread` where the plugin fetches history for the LLM to process.

## III. Reliability & Configuration

13. **Advanced Reconnection Strategies:**
    *   Implement more sophisticated and configurable WebSocket reconnection logic (e.g., exponential backoff with jitter) for increased resilience.
14. **Plugin Health Check Endpoint:**
    *   Add an HTTP endpoint to the plugin that reports its connection status to the GraphQL/LLM agent, useful for monitoring and diagnostics.
15. **Granular Timeout Configuration:**
    *   Allow administrators to configure various WebSocket timeouts (e.g., read, write, handshake) through the plugin settings for finer control.
16. **User-Level API Key Management:**
    *   If the LLM agent uses per-user API keys, provide a secure mechanism for users to configure and manage their keys for the plugin.

## IV. Leveraging LLM Agent Capabilities

17. **Conversation Management Tools:**
    *   Empower the agent to actively assist in managing conversations by suggesting agenda items, tracking discussion points, identifying action items, and summarizing decisions.
18. **Autonomous Project Updates & Monitoring:**
    *   Task the agent to autonomously monitor projects (based on channel activity or other integrations) and provide periodic summaries, progress reports, or risk alerts.
19. **Drafting Assistance:**
    *   Allow users to request the agent's help in drafting messages or replies (e.g., `!maestro draft a project update email`).
