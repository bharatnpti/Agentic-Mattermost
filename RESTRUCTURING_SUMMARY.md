# Code Restructuring Summary

## Overview
The codebase has been restructured to improve maintainability, readability, and follow industry best practices.

## Key Changes

### 1. Package Reorganization
- **Before**: All classes in a single `com.example.mattermost` package
- **After**: Organized into logical packages based on responsibilities:
  - `domain.model` - Core business entities
  - `domain.repository` - Data access interfaces
  - `workflow` - Temporal workflows
  - `workflow.activity` - Workflow activities
  - `service` - Business services
  - `controller` - REST controllers
  - `integration` - External system integrations
  - `config` - Configuration classes
  - `util` - Utility classes

### 2. Separation of Concerns
- Moved embedded classes (like `MessagePayload`) to separate files
- Separated interfaces from implementations
- Isolated external integrations in dedicated packages

### 3. Naming Conventions
- Renamed `PROMPTHOLDER` to `PromptHolder` (following Java conventions)
- Consistent naming across all packages

### 4. Documentation
- Added `package-info.java` files for all packages
- Created `ARCHITECTURE.md` for overall structure documentation
- Clear descriptions of each layer's responsibility

### 5. Test Organization
- Test files moved to mirror the main source structure
- `WorkflowControllerTest` → `controller/WorkflowControllerTest`
- `MeetingSchedulerWorkflowTest` → `workflow/MeetingSchedulerWorkflowTest`

## Benefits

1. **Easier Navigation**: Developers can quickly find relevant code
2. **Better Modularity**: Clear boundaries between different concerns
3. **Improved Testability**: Each layer can be tested in isolation
4. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Changes are localized to specific packages
5. **Clearer Dependencies**: Package structure reflects architectural layers

## Next Steps

1. Update import statements in any configuration files
2. Run tests to ensure everything works correctly
3. Update IDE project settings if needed
4. Consider adding more granular packages as the project grows
